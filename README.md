# Arduino Fire Extinguishing Robot



## Overview

This project involves the development of an Arduino-based Automatic Fire Extinguishing Robot. The robot is designed to detect the presence of fire using sensors and autonomously navigate towards the fire source to extinguish it using a built-in fire extinguisher module.

## Features

- **Fire Detection**: The robot is equipped with flame sensors to detect the presence of fire.

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Utilizes motor control to navigate towards the detected fire source autonomously.

- **Fire Extinguisher Module**: The robot includes a mechanism to release a fire-extinguishing agent when a fire is detected.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Board
- Motor Driver
- Flame Sensor
- Motors and Wheels
- Chassis
- Fire Extinguisher Module
- Batteries or Power Supply



## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/DilshanAbeykoon/Autonomus-Fire-Extinguishing-Robot.git`


## Usage

1. Power on the robot.
2. Place the robot in an environment with potential fire hazards.
3. The robot will autonomously detect and navigate towards any detected fire, releasing the extinguishing agent.
